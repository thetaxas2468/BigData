Question:Is there a connection between happiness of citizens in a country and several social and financial metrics?


Information: In this project we have learned a few more functions and ablities to realize and conclude some important informations about the given data like the correlation table using heatmap
and in the project we have said every thing needed to be said in the comments and in the conclusion we have seen that there is a strong correlation between citizens happiness in a country and a few factors
like :
- Whisker-high

- Whisker-low	

- Explained by: GDP per capita	

- Explained by: Social support	

- Explained by: Healthy life expectancy	

- Explained by: Freedom to make life choices

but the weird part is we have concluded that there are some important factors that can really bring happiness to people in a country and have no relate to what country we are talking about
as a start we thought that money and health is the best factors but we have seen that freedom to make life choices is also GDR(GDP per capita is the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes (less subsidies) not included in the valuation of output, divided by mid-year population).
